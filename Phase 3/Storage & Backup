# üì¶ Phase 3 ‚Äì Storage & Backup (AZ-104 Azure Lab Project)

## üîç Objective
Understand and work with different Azure storage services including Blob, File Shares, Disks, 
and Backups. Learn storage types, access methods, and implement backup strategies.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Completed

### 1. Azure Storage Account
- [x] Created a **General-purpose v2** Storage Account
- [x]Compared **LRS vs GRS vs ZRS** redundancy options
- [x]Explored **Standard vs Premium** tiers

### 2. Blob Storage
- [x] Created a Blob container
- [x] Uploaded and downloaded files
- [x] Tested public access vs SAS token access
- [x] Applied **lifecycle rules** to auto-delete blobs

### 3. Azure Files
- [x] Created a File Share
- [x] Mounted File Share to a VM (Windows or Linux)
- [x] Compared **SMB** and **NFS** options

### 4. Managed Disks
- [x] Added a data disk to an existing VM
- [x] Resized an OS or data disk
- [x] Took a snapshot of a disk

### 5. Backup
- [x] Enabled Azure Backup for a VM
- [x] Created and restored a backup
- [x] Explored Backup Vault settings

### 6. Security & Cost Optimization
- [x] Used **SAS tokens** to share access securely
- [x] Enabled **soft delete** for blobs and files
- [x] Used **storage tiers** (Hot, Cool, Archive) for cost control

## üß† What I Learned
- I feel more confident about utilizing policy tags after reviewing why my storage account wouldn't create.
- My old $200 Azure credit expired with $179 left, so I restarted fresh on a student account.

[ What this means for me: I will now intentionally delete all resources at the end of each session, forcing myself
to practice full deployment and configuration every time. This hands-on repetition ensures I can rebuild 
from scratch on demand‚Äîjust like a real cloud admin‚Äîand helps me deeply retain each step of the Azure workflow.]

- This time, I set up VM backups and Recovery Services Vaults with a cleaner, more organized approach.
- Enabled and tested Azure Backup for a Linux VM, using cost-saving storage and policies.
- Successfully restored a VM from backup, troubleshooting every step for deeper understanding (NSG, public IP, password resets).
- Reinforced and deepened my Azure admin skills, now I am way more confident and efficient than before.
- Set up soft delete for blobs and containers, adding an easy recovery layer for accidental deletes.
- Now I understand how retention periods (ex: 7 days) give a real safety net before permanent deletion.
- The soft delete feature is simple to enable, and adds confidence for handling production data.
- Reinforces the habit of thinking about data protection and disaster recovery early in any setup.
- Each time I build these settings from scratch, I get faster and more comfortable with Azure‚Äôs storage features.
