üåê Phase 4: Azure Networking (In Progress)
In this phase of my AZ-104 Lab Project, I will dive into core Azure networking concepts and hands-on skills. 
My goal is to confidently design, deploy, and secure cloud networks using real Azure 
resources‚Äîbuilding on everything I‚Äôve learned so far.

What I will accomplish in Phase 4:

Design and deploy Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) and subnets from scratch.

Configure and test public and private IP addresses for virtual machines.

Secure resources using Network Security Groups (NSGs) and custom firewall rules.

Practice VNet peering and troubleshoot connectivity between networks.

Apply cost optimization strategies and clean up resources after each session.

What I hope to learn:
By repeatedly setting up and breaking down these network environments, I will reinforce my understanding 
of cloud networking‚Äîfrom secure connectivity to efficient troubleshooting. Each session is a fresh chance 
to improve my skills and approach real-world Azure scenarios with confidence.
