# Phase 5 – Automation

I’ve scripted my AZ-104 lab so a single Git push builds my VNet, VMs, NSGs and Load Balancer (with health checks),
then a scheduled job tears it all down.

- **IaC:** `main.bicep` + modules for network, security, compute, LB  
- **CI:** on-push deploy + smoke-test, scheduled cleanup  
- **Quick verify:** `curl http://<LB-public-IP>/` returns “Hello from webVM!”  

That’s it, fully repeatable & cost-controlled, and concludes my foundation to begin my Azure help-desk sprint. 
On to Ticketing Systems and AZ-900 certification next, after real experience in help desk I'll 
let the AZ104 exam have my best shot!
